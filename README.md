# Financial Account Ownership Analysis

This project uses R and R Markdown to analyze trends in account ownership at financial institutions or mobile money service providers. It explores differences by **gender** and **education level** across multiple countries and years (2014, 2017, 2021).

## Objectives

- Visualize trends in financial account ownership.
- Compare demographic groups across countries.
- Identify disparities by gender and education level.
- Highlight changes over time to assess progress in financial inclusion.

## Data Sources

Data is sourced from the [World Bank Global Findex Database](https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/) and includes:

- **By Gender**:  
  - Female (% of population ages 15+)  
  - Male (% of population ages 15+)

- **By Education Level**:  
  - Primary education or less (% of population ages 15+)  
  - Secondary education or more (% of population ages 15+)

## Technologies Used

- **R**
- **R Markdown**
- **ggplot2** for data visualization
- **dplyr** and **tidyverse** for data wrangling

## Key Insights

- In **Brazil** and **India**, males have higher account ownership than females, but the gap has narrowed over time.
- The **United States** maintains high and nearly equal ownership rates across genders.
- Individuals with **secondary education** show consistently higher account ownership than those with **primary education or less**.
- Account ownership increased across almost all demographics from **2014 to 2021**, indicating progress in global financial inclusion.
- A notable shift in growth appears around **2017**, suggesting a potential inflection point in global or national financial inclusion policies.

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates clear links between gender, education, and access to financial services. While global progress is evident, disparities remain, particularly in lower-education groups and emerging economies. Continued efforts are needed to close these gaps and promote inclusive access to financial systems.
